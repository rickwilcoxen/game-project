  1. Planning
  2. Set up
  3. Game UI pt 1
  4. game engine
  5. game ui pt 2
  6. Authentication
  7. still working on:
    - game api

#Technology Used
  - html

#What still needs fixing
##Bugs
  - can't change password! not sure what's up with this.

##UI
  - add message when game over (win or draw)
  - don't allow users to add x or o to space after game over

##Game API
  - create game, start new game
  - update game, play the game
  - get games
