#What still needs fixing
##Bugs
  - can't sign up or sign in, this has some errors and probably has to do with
  the config.js file as the errors that keep appearing have to do with the
  associated url.

##UI
  - add message when game over (win or draw)
  - don't allow users to add x or o to space after game over

##Game API
  - create game, start new game
  - update game, play the game
  - get games
